## gridworld environment

```
 0   1   2   3(g)     ← goal (green, +1, terminal)
 4   5(w) 6   7(d)    ← wall (blocked), danger (red, -1, non-terminal)
 8(s) 9  10  11       ← start (bottom-left)
```

| parameter | value |
|-----------|-------|
| grid size | 3x4 (12 states) |
| actions | up, right, left, down |
| start | state 8 (bottom-left) |
| wall | state 5 (bounce back) |
| goal | state 3 (+1, terminal) |
| danger | state 7 (-1, non-terminal) |

## algorithms

### i. on-policy mc with exploring starts
each episode starts at a random (state, action) pair, then follows the greedy policy. guarantees full coverage of the state-action space from episode 1

### ii. on-policy mc without exploring starts
always starts from state 8. picks random actions 10% of the time, greedy 90%. true on-policy learning without exploring starts

### iii. off-policy mc prediction
evaluates a target policy (the greedy policy from algorithm i) using episodes collected by a uniform random behaviour policy. uses weighted importance sampling to correct for the distribution mismatch

### iv. off-policy mc control
learns a greedy target policy while following a uniform random behaviour policy. the most general setup — full exploration while converging to the optimal policy

all four use **first-visit mc** for lower variance

## results

### learned q-table (exploring starts)

| state | up | right | left | down | best |
|-------|----|-------|------|------|------|
| 0 | 0.468 | **0.616** | 0.476 | 0.343 | right |
| 1 | 0.607 | **0.755** | 0.486 | 0.617 | right |
| 2 | 0.743 | **0.900** | 0.617 | 0.617 | right |
| goal | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | - |
| 4 | **0.484** | 0.352 | 0.343 | 0.187 | up |
| 6 | **0.754** | -0.245 | 0.601 | 0.472 | up |
| fire | **0.900** | -0.245 | 0.608 | 0.327 | up |
| start | **0.356** | 0.342 | 0.165 | 0.216 | up |
| 9 | 0.340 | **0.482** | 0.219 | 0.353 | right |
| 10 | **0.612** | 0.346 | 0.353 | 0.458 | up |
| 11 | -0.245 | 0.350 | **0.483** | 0.346 | left |

the learned policy routes from start (8) → up → 4 → up → 0 → right → 1 → right → 2 → right → goal (3)

### sample output
| state | v(s) |
|-------|------|
| 0 | 0.578 |
| 1 | 0.726 |
| 2 | 0.900 |
| goal | 0.000 |
| 4 | 0.444 |
| 6 | 0.726 |
| fire | 0.900 |
| start | 0.331 |
| 9 | 0.448 |
| 10 | 0.574 |
| 11 | 0.402 |

all four algorithms converge successfully. on-policy methods converge faster (~8k episodes) while off-policy methods require ~16k episodes due to importance sampling variance

### figures

### learned policies

![policy comparison - all three control methods](docs/02-results/fig01_mc_policies.png)

figure 1 compares the q-value heatmaps and policy arrows for all three control methods. all three discover essentially the same optimal path: start (8) → up → 4 → up → 0 → right → 1 → right → 2 → right → goal (3). the off-policy control method has noisier q-values at less-visited states but the policy stays correct.

### off-policy prediction heatmap

![state-value function from weighted is](docs/02-results/fig02_mc_prediction.png)

figure 2 shows the state-value function v(s) estimated by off-policy weighted importance sampling. the target policy is the greedy policy learned by algorithm i. the heatmap clearly shows higher values near the goal, with the wall cell blanked out.

### learning curves

![episode reward curves (window=200)](docs/02-results/fig03_mc_learning_curves.png)

figure 3 plots total reward per episode smoothed over 200 episodes. all three methods converge to stable positive reward:
- **exploring starts** - converges fastest, reaching positive reward within ~500 episodes
- **epsilon-greedy** - slightly slower start because the 10% random actions add noise, but converges to the same level
- **off-policy control** - takes the longest and has the most variance (needs 2x episodes), because the uniform behaviour policy generates lots of irrelevant trajectories
